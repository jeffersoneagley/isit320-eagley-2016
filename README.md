# README #

This is my repo for my ISIT320 coursework! 

This course entailed further study of client-server-db interactions using a javascript-based maze game as a client frontend and Node.js/express as a backend. The game itself is a 3d maze built on the THREEJS engine, and the complexity can be found in amount of content being held by the database.
